# Carcinogenicity_Prediction

This project, created during a hackathon, focuses on predicting the carcinogenicity of organic compounds based on their chemical structure. It aims to contribute to the rapid identification of potential toxic effects of new molecules. The data is sourced from the CSV file "Carcinogenicity_Carcinogenicity.csv" in the toxric database, containing carcinogenic toxicity values (1 or 0) for 1021 molecules. Chemical descriptors were calculated from SMILES formats using the RDKit module in Python.

Methodology and Evaluation of Carcinogenicity Prediction

Various binary classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN), were employed to build the carcinogenicity prediction model. These choices were based on their ability to handle classification problems and accurately predict the carcinogenicity of organic compounds.

Performance evaluation relied on common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve. These indicators were used to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting carcinogenicity and to compare the different approaches.
